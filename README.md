# PC-AGENT-REMOTE: Your AI Copilot for Remote PC Control

**Built for the [Launch IO Hackathon](https://io.net/hackathon#overview)**

---

## üöÄ What is PC-AGENT-REMOTE?

PC-AGENT-REMOTE is an advanced, real-world AI agent system that lets you control your Windows PC from any device using natural language. It‚Äôs built on top of Microsoft's agent framework and now integrates directly with the IO Intelligence API, making it a perfect fit for the hackathon‚Äôs ‚ÄúAutonomous Agents in the Real World‚Äù track.

---

## üèÜ Why It‚Äôs a Great Fit for the Hackathon

- **Uses IO Intelligence API**: All LLM calls are routed through the IO Intelligence API, as required by the hackathon.
- **Real-World Automation**: Lets users perform complex, multi-app tasks on their PC remotely, just by describing what they want.
- **Live Human-AI Interaction**: Users see the agent‚Äôs actions in real time via live screen streaming.
- **Extensible & Modular**: Built to be extended with new agent types, workflows, and integrations.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. **User connects via a web/mobile frontend** (beautiful, responsive UI).
2. **User sends a natural language request** (e.g., ‚ÄúFind the latest sales report and email it to my manager‚Äù).
3. **Request is routed to the backend Flask server**, which manages sessions and logs.
4. **PC-AGENT-REMOTE interprets and executes the task** using the IO Intelligence LLM API for reasoning and planning.
5. **Live screen sharing** lets the user watch the agent work in real time.
6. **System logs and task status** are streamed back to the frontend for transparency.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features (Expanded)

- **Prompt-Based Control:** No need for a virtual mouse‚Äîjust describe your task in plain English.
- **Live Screen Streaming:** Watch your PC‚Äôs screen in real time from your phone or browser.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Host, App, Evaluation, and Backup agents coordinate to complete tasks.
- **Session Management:** Launch, monitor, and stop tasks with clear feedback and logs.
- **Modern, Mobile-First UI:** Designed for usability on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Secure & Configurable:** API keys and endpoints are managed securely; supports multiple agent types and models.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies

- **IO Intelligence API**: All LLM calls use the required API (see `IOIntelligenceService` in `ufo/llm/`).
- **Flask + Flask-SocketIO**: Backend server for task management, logs, and real-time screen streaming.
- **Modern Web Frontend**: Responsive, mobile-friendly interface for launching and monitoring tasks.
- **PyAutoGUI**: For screen capture and automation.
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Host, App, Evaluation, and Backup agents, all configurable for IO Intelligence.

## üîë Example: IO Intelligence Integration

```python
from ufo.llm.base import BaseService

class IOIntelligenceService(BaseService):
    # ... (see your code above for full implementation)
    def chat_completion(self, messages, ...):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/chat/completions"
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {io_intelligence_api_key}"}
        # ... (rest of the logic)
```

Configuration (in your config):

```yaml
HOST_AGENT:
  API_TYPE: "iointelligence"
  API_BASE: "https://api.intelligence.io.solutions/api/v1"
  API_KEY: "<your-key>"
  API_MODEL: "meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8"
  # ... (other settings)
```
